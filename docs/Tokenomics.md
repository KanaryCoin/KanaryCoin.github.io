#### This is one of the most important parts of a project, we have been analyzing it and adjusting it as best as possible so that the people who receive the airdrop optimize their profits without compromising the project.

#### We have decided on this division of the tokens because there are many memecoins that fail due to a poor division of their tokens, we have made this decision for you and the project.
