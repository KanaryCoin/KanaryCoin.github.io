# ​How do I get the Airdrop? 🎁​

Of the entire drop, <code>60%</code> will be allocated to the community.

The only way to get the airdrop is by fulfilling the missions that are being proposed in the Telegram group and on Twitter.

The remaining <code>40%</code> will be distributed strategic way to list the token on relevant platforms and launch a Kanary ambassadors.

### Composed of 3 phases:

- 🪂​ **Airdrop Base** :  The base airdrop will be distributed to all people who do at least one of the tasks proposed by the Kanary team, but the amount of $KNRY you will get depends on how many missions and activities you have.

- 🎰​ **Betting phase** : In this phase, before the coin has value you can bet it for a limited amount of time, the objective of this activity is that you can get many more <code>$KNRY</code> by risking what you have, clearly this phase is not mandatory, but you decide.

- ⚔️​ **Clashes** :  We currently cannot give much information about the next phase for competitive reasons with other memecoins, but it is like the previous phase but better 🔥​.

### Current ways to get the airdrop:

- **Staking** : Currently it can be done from [DragonStake](https://www.dragonstake.io/en) or from the Cryptonitas pool [number 61.](https://staking.polkadot.network/#/pools).

- **Zelay** : Several [Zealy](https://zealy.io/c/kanary/invite/IkAfpcJ7L2HaJsjgxbNw6) campaigns will be created, of which the first positioned in the ranking will get many more <code>$KNRY</code> and multipliers.

- **Twitter** : Activity on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kanarytoken) supporting the team and the project is also very helpful and will be taken into account.
