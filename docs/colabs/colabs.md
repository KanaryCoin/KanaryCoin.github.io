# ‚ÄãAlliances ü§ù‚Äã

Currently, the project has the following alliances active:

- **Kanary X DragonStake** : Gain more experience and accumulate achievements by following [DragonStake](https://www.dragonstake.io/en) on Twitter and LinkedIn through the Zealy campaign.

- **Kanary X Cryptonitas Pool** : Staking in pool [number 61](https://staking.polkadot.network/#/pools) gives you an airdrop multiplier.

- **Kanary X BitAvatar** : The code KANARY on the website [BITAVATAR](https://polkadot.bitavatar.io/) will allow users to generate an NFT avatar completely for free to use in the multiple metaverses that are about to be launched on MNet. There will likely be an extra airdrop surprise for users who showcase their avatars on Twitter adding the hashtag #kanarymask #kanarytoken.

- **Kanary X Zealy** : A platform where communities are being organized. Kanary Team has announced significant benefits for all participants in our [Zealy](https://zealy.io/c/kanary/invite/IkAfpcJ7L2HaJsjgxbNw6) campaign as a percentage of the supply will go exclusively to the most active users.
