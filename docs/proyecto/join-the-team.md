# Join the Team ðŸ«‚â€‹

We want you to be part of the team through the ambassador system. This system will provide users with rewards that will vary according to their activity and decisions within the team. This will benefit the Kanary ecosystem itself by increasing activity on networks and order within the ecosystem.

The ambassador system consists of:

- **Help the team**: You will be part of the team and you will find out before anyone else about all the team's progress and ideas, being able to contribute your grain of sand yourself.

- **Advertise massively**: Followers on Twitter will be taken into account, since the objective of an ambassador is for as many people as possible to know about the existence of Kanary.

- **Get more rewards**: With the envajador method you will get a large amount of extra Kanary, since your work will be much greater than any member.

- **Ambassador rotation**: If an ambassador does not measure up or practically does not contribute to the community or the team, he will be replaced by another whose objective is to take Kanary to the top.
