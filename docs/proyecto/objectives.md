# What are our objectives? 🎯​

Kanary Coin doesn't just have one objective; it has several varied goals to take this project to a high level to compete against other more established memecoins in the system like Doge, Shiba, or Pepe.

### Community 💎​

One of our main objectives as a good example of a memecoin is to build a strong and decentralized community. To achieve this, we will carry out various marketing campaigns with the aim of attracting as many people as possible to participate in this great project. Additionally, we want the community itself to be self-sustaining, allowing them to organize their own campaigns to help Kanary Coin, with the possibility of providing them with financial assistance.

The community is one of the most important parts of the project; without you, we would be nothing. The main idea is to take care of, increase, and entertain the community, following various dynamics that we will implement over time such as games to increase the token count. As the main objective, it is to be one of the largest memecoin communities based on memes, marketing, prizes, tournaments, and many more activities that other leading memecoins do not have.

### Trojan Horse for the Polkadot Ecosystem 🐎​

Polkadot can be a complicated and overwhelming ecosystem for anyone starting in the crypto world, which is why many choose not to even try to inform themselves. Our goal is to bring all those people closer to the Polkadot ecosystem in a more fun way, in addition to making the ecosystem itself more flexible and tranquil, as there are not many memecoins in it.

### Entertainment 🎮​

We aim to provide entertainment to the community through various missions and dynamics that we will implement to strengthen and have fun in this ecosystem.

### Wars 🧨​

The dynamics of wars will be taken when the community itself decides it is ready; the objective is to go to war with other memecoins or even projects, letting them know which is the best project of all. 

:::caution Caution 
Wars aim to have fun and create healthy competition among different communities, with no intention to sabotage or discredit a project.

### 🔥​🔥​ Token Burns by Community 🔥​🔥​

As a good memecoin, we will implement various token burn functions to increase interest and the value of the memecoin. We cannot reveal more yet, but we will implement it after listing on the first CEX, so if you are reading this, consider yourself fortunate because this information is very valuable.
