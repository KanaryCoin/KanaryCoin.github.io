# ​Our Strategy 🤔​

The strategy we will follow has three phases as follows:

-	🥚 ​Egg: This is the earliest phase of the project, in which we will define the parameters and guidelines to follow throughout the project. This phase will be completed when we launch the first marketing campaign with DragonStake.

-	🐣​ Chick: In this phase, we will be working much more on creating products, such as games, documents, etc. The goal of this phase is to create products that the community can use and enjoy, as it is the most important pillar of the project. This phase will be completed when the airdrop begins.

-	🐦 Kanary: This phase is the most important and delicate at the same time. The objective of this phase is to make the airdrop as organized and balanced as possible. After the airdrop, the initial phases of the project will have concluded, but its construction will not be completed entirely. From this phase onward, we will follow the "annual roadmaps."

Starting from the Kanary phase, the project's ideas and objectives will be documented through "annual roadmaps" so that all users have an idea of where the project aims to go.
